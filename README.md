# Esri JS Map accessing AGOL.
### Displaying an esri map using our unique API key from agol.
### Display a point, polylin, and polygon on the map.
### Adding a popup message.
### REST URL service to add the information to our map. REST allows content from a web server like AGOL to be rendered on our web map when we request, often referred to as Dynamic Content. (i.e. Upload a shapefile to agol, or used the available files on agol, get the url, display on the webpage using Featurelayer(), add popup of the fields of interest)
### Changing the icon of the points shown on the webpage
### sql query of the attribute table of the points and just showing the points meet the query conditions
